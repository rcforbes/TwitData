# TwitData

This project is currently a work in progress. I have pulled tweets that include "inaugertion" on the 2021 inaugeration day in the USA. I am aiming to use the data to practice conducting sentiment analysis. In the future, I am aiming to pull tweets surrounding morally-charged events and examine how moral language (Moral Foundations Dictionary; Graham et al., 2009) use predicts engagement.
